## Analytics in Data Science




**Key Points:**
- Predictive analytics and machine learning go hand-in-hand, as predictive models typically include a machine learning algorithm. - **[[SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_gb/insights/articles/analytics/a-guide-to-predictive-analytics-and-machine-learning.html)]**
- predictive analytics uses advanced mathematics to **examine patterns to predict the future.** 
-  **Machine learning is a tool that automates predictive modeling** by generating training algorithms to look for patterns and behaviors in data without explicitly being told what to look for. - **[[TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/Machine-learning-and-predictive-analytics-work-better-together)]**
- **The goal of machine learning is autonomous programming and learning â€“ the enablement of AI**. The difference between data science vs. machine learning is that **data scientists create the algorithms that make machine learning happen**. - **[[CSWeb.Rice](https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/online-mds/blog/data-science-vs-ai-and-ml)]**

**Question:**
> How do I apply the theory in practice? how data analyst actually work in real-life? 

**Note:**
> You need to watch the videos above before exercise the case that I'm about to list below. We are going to focus on `Descriptive` and `Diagnostic` only since it is the steps that Data Scientist do before doing Machine Learning.

**Key Points:**
- Build a custome model from scratch or use pre-built Model
- To built a model from scratch you need to create your own equation, which mean you need to know math
- Math consist of **geometry**, **algebra**, **statistics & probability**, and **calculus**
- **Statistics & probability** is needed for all data science role
- Having a limited understanding of **Linier Algebra** is going to help

## Data Analyst Setup
Most of the data science tutorials in the internet require us to follow along by writing code, creating visuals, loading datasets, and doing statistics analysis ect. How am i gonna practice those if i don't have my computer ready, isn't?
