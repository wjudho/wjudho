|**What** is happening in my business|**Why** is it happening|**What's** more likely happen in the future|**What** do i need to do|
|Which customer has highest purchase|Identify character & behaviour pattern why profitable customer buy more|Identify weather & location to see if they're contributing to demand then create a model to predict occurence|Steps to take in order to develop new products (market penetration, cost reduction, budget allocation|

**Key Points:**
- Predictive analytics and machine learning go hand-in-hand, as predictive models typically include a machine learning algorithm. - **[[SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_gb/insights/articles/analytics/a-guide-to-predictive-analytics-and-machine-learning.html)]**
- predictive analytics uses advanced mathematics to **examine patterns to predict the future.** 
-  **Machine learning is a tool that automates predictive modeling** by generating training algorithms to look for patterns and behaviors in data without explicitly being told what to look for. - **[[TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/Machine-learning-and-predictive-analytics-work-better-together)]**

**Key Points:**
- Build a custome model from scratch or use pre-built Model
- To built a model from scratch you need to create your own equation, which mean you need to know math
- Math consist of **geometry**, **algebra**, **statistics & probability**, and **calculus**
- **Statistics & probability** is needed for all data science role
- Having a limited understanding of **Linier Algebra** is going to help 

## Data Analyst Setup
Most of the data science tutorials in the internet require us to follow along by writing code, creating visuals, loading datasets, and doing statistics analysis ect. How am i gonna practice those if i don't have my computer ready, isn't?
