<details><summary><strong>WHAT WORKS FOR ME</strong></summary>

> Understand what motivates you is going to help in tough time

- for me, I don't understand math since high school, even so I still learn machine learning just because we are living in a world where climate change is getting real by days, where AI took our job, and excel was the only thing i've work on for the past 8 years. I'am concern by that fact and the future of where we're living in 

> Take a course
- [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Google&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Analytics&nbsp;Professional&nbsp;Certificate-0056D2?style=flat-square&logo=Coursera&logoColor=white)](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) was my most logic & best decision. it took me less than a month to finish the course. The best part of this course is their final exam which require me to put portfolio on **Kaggle**, was kind of `force` me to put portfolio. I'm glad i did, because in this place, i learned that there are so many Data Scientist that show case their work for free, can you imagine reading people's work and learn that that can actually be copied to you to exercise.

> on the syllabus, they don't mention anything about modelling or machine learning. Right, because their course teaching materials are aimed at educating a Junior Data Analyst. <br>

</center>

**Back to Kaggle**

- Documenting my portfolio in `kaggle` and `github` tremendously help me preserved the experience. I do forget syntax every now and then, but i know where to look. Since then i've never take notes anymore.
- In a course, I usually skip the theory straight into question, `fail faster fail smarter`. `Get the problem quick, then look for an answer`. If i know what they're trying to solve it would mean real-world problem. 
- I prefer `end-to-end project` where the gave tutorial on project based from start to finish (example: data science project ETL & EDA from Excel, SQL, Tableau, then Python). My brain processing `General to Detail` or `macro to micro` faster.
- Everytime I try to learn something new, i always force myself to understand from general perspective first then look for specific detail later. Some people may call it `reverse-engineer`. By doing that everytime i look for detail, since I remember the general view, my brain always try to spot the missing information better than doing the opposite.
- Always start a book from introductory page. The Author usually mention like: 
  - `who should read this book` or 
  - `what this book cover and not` or 
  - `what this book assuming reader's prerequisite knowledge`.

> ## Picture is Worth Thousand Words - **Fred R.Barnard**

</center><br>

- Reading a book without without a proper research on topics is like a man on a jungle for me. I tried read [[Python for data analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)] back when i wasn't aware the purpose of handling missing data. We remove the missing value, so what's the purpose? it's daunting back then, since i have no knowledge on data science `theres to much unanswered 5W+1H` it overwhelmed me. I didn't know where to start. Even hours of googling didn't help because there were no `structured big picture`.
- i took several interactive online course on `Python, R, SQL` a few were finished most were left unfinished. To those which i finished, just after a few months i forgot what i've learned.
- I tried to memorize code, turned out there are too many syntax and variation i couldn't even keeping up.

> I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand. - **Confucius**
- Watching tutorial most of the time doesn't work for me. I wish it would, but everytime i learn basic function in python it makes me sleepy.
- i took [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Basic&nbsp;Algebra&nbsp;Introduction&nbsp;Crash&nbsp;Course-FF0000?style=flat-square&logo=Youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grnP3mduZkM)&nbsp;[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mathematics&nbsp;for&nbsp;Machine&nbsp;Learning-0F4C75?style=flat-square&logo=learn&logoColor=white)](https://mml-book.com/)&nbsp;[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Essense&nbsp;of&nbsp;Linier&nbsp;Algebra-FF0000?style=flat-square&logo=Youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) which are very recommended by a lot of people on the internet. 
>The problem is, i couldn't imagine the real world application on those math, simply because i learned best by copying or duplicate other people's work. I learned best when there's a problem and solution to solve it. 

**Let me rephrase it this way**

> I know `1 + 1 = 2`, I don't know what to do with it. Then somebody gave me a problem `Wis, i need you to count how many PC's we've been sold this month?` suddenly those connect. `Which one should i learn first, the former or the latter?`. The problem is i wanna know what would he want to count the computer and why does it have to be `1 + 1 = 2`, 
  - `I need to know WHAT's the problem`
  - `I also need to know the reason as to WHY yo do that`
  - `I will find the HOW`

The problem is from the data science perspective `i don't know how to count`, and `have no idea what the problem are`. I can learn how to count but i'm afraid it will took me a long time to get to the problem. Somebody might tells me how to do it, but then my confusion is `why did they do it that way`

> What if I learn by doing. Go straight to the problem, then search tutorial on how to count.

The second problem arise. There are far too many variation in using operators `(*/+-)`. Do I have to remember all of those calculations exercise? on the other hand Machine Learning in itself has far too many algorithm to study, it doesn't stop there, when pre-built algorithm proved to be inadequate, Data Scientist will actually built their own equation and using it as a model for their machine learning algorithm. 

> That thought lead me to think: "is tutorial enough ?"

**Think for a second!**

> how can i give you iPhone11 if i don't have prototipe 1,2,3,...10. “The iPhone was designed to be a super slick phone in Steve Jobs' mind,” but then they want to give it music player, then camera, then navigation, then into the culturally dominant, world-eating phenomenon that it is today. They desire results! not even mention, they are working as team which mean it's a company there is always someone who will correct you if something is wrong.

**Which leads me to conclusion**

> The quickest way to learn is to look at others who learned it before me. Learn just enough to do the work, probably how to read code, how to follow the tutorial, then work on portfolio 1,2,3,4,..10 i don't care how many, until confidence built-up, then move on

here's the thing, sometimes i stumbled upon a dataset in kaggle, and don't understand what their codes supposed to do, then i google it until it makes sense, often i google for half a day but no result, `i realize i jumped too far`. Most of the time, i just don't know what to search.

> this is where documenting our work in github and kaggle are important. it teachs me that writing actually helps to spot lacks in my knowledge and understanding. Have you ever been in a situation where you've learned a material, but couldn't explain to others. Our brain tricks itself into the thinking that we understand a subject completely. Turned out, it isn't

> This is why people documenting their youtube channel. Some people decide to write, some speak to camera, others create a course. Learn by teachs it to others.

> was looking at other's work enough?

There was various method in every data scientist. I can't even fathom what's the origin of their method. often i see a terminology from statistics, and most of the time they put a lot of charts and i ended up just skimming through the material and have no patient in looking at what they actually do.

> The sooner you are exposed to the field, the faster you will learn

- Understand you, what you have what you lack
- Creates a small win and confidence (for me getting a certificate really boost by a lot)
- Always remember to `learn just enough`, Usually enough to work on a project on your portfolio. Because learning to code is daunting and most people says overwhelming by how many the technology and syntax they need to learn in order to do their job. `This is not an act of limiting our capabilities`, 

> I know my limitation, Data Science is not a goal, it is a journey. 

So are you doing sprint or marathon, which one are you?

- Learn to rest, not to quit. Quit only if you don't like the idea of this job role.

**Disclaimer:**
> Don't take advice from me, i'm just trying to learn what works for me. It may or may not work for you.

throughout this entire `Roadmap` we will focusing on curating Data Scientist's work on kaggle. Be it their steps, their library, their model, their visualization, their thought process. At the end of the day there's a saying:

# **WHAT I AM CONFUSED OF**
## **What Do Data Scientist Do**

>The survey of about 80 data scientists was conducted for the second year in a row by CrowdFlower, provider of a “data enrichment” platform for data scientists. Data preparation accounts for about 80% of the work of data scientists. Here are the highlights: - **[[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/?sh=79a901676f63)]**

> **KeyPoint:** 
> - There are various role in Data Science
> - Data Analyst is the Entry Level Role in this profession

## **What Statistics Are We Talking About**

<p align="center">
<img width="599" height="558" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjudho/wjudho/main/images/practicalds.png">
</p>

>This picture above is a table of content from book [[Practical Statistics for Data Scientist](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/149207294X)] if you want to learn Data Science from both perspective `(Statistics and programming language such as Python/R)` I suggest reading the book.

## **Is The Statistics Generally Apply to Any Case**

> i've try to learn from [[**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/code?sortBy=voteCount&language=Python&tagIds=13201)] `try to open a few of their portofolio/cases/exercises from the link`, i thought i could take key point or similarities between several kernel just to understand their standard approach/steps. Suddenly there's are so many question popped up in my mind.

- What the visual have to do with analysis
- Where do I start? There are so many terminology i don't familiar with
- I tried reading statistics book, it doesn't get any better. Either i found textbook (too much text), Practical book (too much equation), or i couldn't get the big picture because some book explain the tools not the process of statistics. I mean why there are so many test? what are they trying to achieve? can i pick just one test? What are the standard process for statistics? what are the steps to do statistics?
- What is the purpose of statistics? What is Statistics? can i learn Data Science without understanding the Statistics?

> Having no background in Statistics, no idea terminology and purpose of it's test were really overwhelming. I couldn't even properly googling the term. 

i've been searching every blog, youtube, books just for the sake to get the answer of this one big question: `What is the relationship between all of those test`. My brain tells me, the only way i can learn better is by having a big picture of statistics, `how do i do that?`

- Statistics is subfield of mathematics - **[[MachineLearningMastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-statistics/)]**
- Statistics allow researchers to collect information, or data, from a large number of people and then summarize their typical experience. […] Statistics are also used to reach conclusions about general differences between groups. […] Statistics can also be used to see if scores on two variables are related and to make predictions. - **[[StatisticsInPlainEnglish, pages ix-x, 2010](https://amzn.to/2Gv0A2V)]**

## **Statistics for Data Science Roadmap**



**Key Points:**
- `Machine learning` and `predictive modeling` are a computer science perspective on modeling data with a focus on algorithmic methods and model skill. `Statistics` and `statistical learning` are a mathematical perspective on modeling data with a focus on data models and on goodness of fit. - **[[MachineLearningMastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/relationship-between-applied-statistics-and-machine-learning/)]**


- Descriptive statistics are typically used as a preliminary step before more formal inferences are drawn. - **[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference)]**
- In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics. - **[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)]**
- Predictive analytics and machine learning go hand-in-hand, as predictive models typically include a machine learning algorithm. - **[[SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_gb/insights/articles/analytics/a-guide-to-predictive-analytics-and-machine-learning.html)]**
- predictive analytics uses advanced mathematics to **examine patterns to predict the future.** 
-  **Machine learning is a tool that automates predictive modeling** by generating training algorithms to look for patterns and behaviors in data without explicitly being told what to look for. - **[[TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/Machine-learning-and-predictive-analytics-work-better-together)]**
- **The goal of machine learning is autonomous programming and learning – the enablement of AI**. The difference between data science vs. machine learning is that **data scientists create the algorithms that make machine learning happen**. - **[[CSWeb.Rice](https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/online-mds/blog/data-science-vs-ai-and-ml)]**

# PART II

## Data Analyst Setup
Most of the data science tutorials in the internet require us to follow along by writing code, creating visuals, loading datasets, and doing statistics analysis ect. How am i gonna practice those if i don't have my computer ready, isn't? 
<br>

**First, let's try to clear some un-answered question on our mind**

<detailss><summary><strong>Supposed you stumbled upon error where you can't commit version in kaggle, this might be the answer</strong></summary>

> `Error in parse(text = x, srcfile = src):` usually unsupported library is the cause, simply refrain from using it. Other cause is missing doublequote (") or quote(')
</detailss>
<br>


# PART III

> At this point I believe `PART I` will be proven helpful in the upcoming tutorial. You might recall most of `PART I` terminology in this `PART II` and that's a great sign that our brain is learning. There will be a lot more of terminology that sounds unfamiliar in this section so I will leave these reference down below for you to come back whenever you need. Sometimes we don't know what to google, right? or sometimes we could find nothing from google, this reference will come in handy.

## Our First Picked Exercise-Project

> Let's go get our hands dirty by diving straight into the problem. Let's see how much our brain can handle. I specifically looking for a simple project and try to explain it. This project will consist of **collection, cleaning, and EDA**, Remember `just enough` to get the confidence and move on to the next project. Don't worry if you don't understand it. The purpose of this is to get the view of end result and what Data Scientist trying to achieve. We will discuss detail specific every life cycle in the next section `as I learned along the way ` 






## Implementing Data Science Life Cycle

> **Note:** We will omit `Data Collection process` from this table as it already included in every project on **Kaggle**

## Data Analyst Setup
Most of the data science tutorials in the internet require us to follow along by writing code, creating visuals, loading datasets, and doing statistics analysis ect. How am i gonna practice those if i don't have my computer ready, isn't?
