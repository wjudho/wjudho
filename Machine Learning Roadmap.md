>**What works for me?**

<details><summary><strong>answer</strong></summary>

**what works**
- I don't understand math since high school, even so I still learn machine learning just because we are living in a world where climate change is getting real by days, where AI took our job, and excel is the only thing i've work on for the past 8 years
- Took [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Google&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Analytics&nbsp;Specialization-0056D2?style=flat-square&logo=Coursera&logoColor=white)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/XUGJCTUHJT9V) is my most logic & best decision. it took me less than a month to finish the course. The best part of this course is their final exam which require me to put portfolio on **Kaggle**. The place where i learned that there are so many Data Scientist that show case their work for free, can you imagine reading people's work and learn that that can actually be copied to you to exercise.
- Documenting in `kaggle` and `github` into a portfolio tremendously help me to preserved the experience. I do forget syntax every now and then, but i know where to look. Since then i've never take notes anymore.
- In a course, I usually skip the theory straight into question, `fail faster fail smarter`. `Get the problem quick, then look for an answer`. If i know what they're trying to solve it would mean real-world problem. 
- I prefer `end-to-end project` where the gave tutorial on project based from start to finish (example: data science project ETL & EDA from Excel, SQL, Tableau, then Python). My brain processing `General to Detail` or `macro to micro` faster.
- Everytime I try to learn something new, i always force myself to understand from general perspective first then look for specific detail. Some people may call it `reverse-engineer`. By doing that everytime i look for detail, since I remember the general view, my brain always try to spot the missing information better than doing the opposite.

**What doesn't work for me?**

<details><summary><strong>answer</strong></summary>

- i took several interactive online course on `Python, R, SQL` a few were finished most were left unfinished. To those which i finished, just after a few months i forgot what i've learned.

- I tried to memorize code turned out there are too many syntax and variation i couldn't keep up.

> I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand. - **Confucius**
- Watching tutorial most of the time doesn't work for me. I wish it would, but everytime i learn basic function in python it makes me sleepy.
 
- i took [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Basic&nbsp;Algebra&nbsp;Introduction&nbsp;Crash&nbsp;Course-FF0000?style=flat-square&logo=Youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grnP3mduZkM)&nbsp;[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mathematics&nbsp;for&nbsp;Machine&nbsp;Learning-0F4C75?style=flat-square&logo=learn&logoColor=white)](https://mml-book.com/)&nbsp;[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Essense&nbsp;of&nbsp;Linier&nbsp;Algebra-FF0000?style=flat-square&logo=Youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) which are very recommended by a lot of people on the internet. 
>The problem is, i couldn't imagine the real world application on those math, simply because i learned best by copying or duplicate other people's work. I learned best when there's a problem and solution to solve it. 

**Let me rephrase it this way**

> I know `1 + 1 = 2`, I don't know what to do with it. Then somebody gave me a problem `Wis, i need you to count how many PC's we've been sold this month?` suddenly those connect. 

The problem is i `don't know how to count`, and `have no idea what's the problem are`. I can learn how to count but i'm afraid it will took me a long time to get to the problem.

> What if I learn by doing. Go straight to the problem, then search tutorial on how to count.

The second problem arise. There are far too many variation in using operators `(*/+-)`. Do I have to remember all of those calculations exercise? on the other hand Machine Learning in itself has far too many algorithm to study, it doesn't stop there, when pre-built algorithm proved to be inadequate, Data Scientist will actually built their own equation and using it as a model for their machine learning algorithm. 

> That thought lead me to think: "is tutorial enough ?"

**Think for a second!**

> how can i give you iPhone11 if i don't have prototipe 1,2,3,...10. “The iPhone was designed to be a super slick phone in Steve Jobs' mind,” but then they want to give it music player, then camera, then navigation, then into the culturally dominant, world-eating phenomenon that it is today. They desire results!

**Which leads me to conclusion**

> The quickest way to learn is to look at others who learned it before me. Learn just enough to do the work, probably how to read code, how to follow the tutorial, then work on portfolio 1,2,3,4,..10 i don't care how many, until confidence built-up, then move on

sometimes i stumbled upon a dataset in kaggle, and don't understand what their codes supposed to do, then i google it until it makes sense, often i google for half a day but no result, i realize i jumped too far.

> this is where documenting our work in github and kaggle are important. it teachs me that writing actually helps to spot lacks in my knowledge and understanding. Have you ever been in a situation where you've learned a material, but couldn't explain to others.

> This is why people documenting their youtube channel. Some people decide to write, some speak to camera, others create a course. Learn by teachs it to others.

<details><summary><strong>answer</strong></summary>

- Understand you, what you have what you lack
- Creates a small win and confidence (for me getting a certificate really boost by a lot)
- Always remember to `learn just enough`, because learning to code is daunting and most people says overwhelming by how many the technology and programming-language they need to learn in order to do their job
- Learn to rest, not to quit. Quit only if you don't like the idea of this job role.
- Don't take advice from me, i'm just trying to learn what works for me. It may or may not work for you.

throughout this entire `Roadmap` we will focusing on curating Data Scientist's work on kaggle. Be it their steps, their library, their model, their visualization, their thought process. At the end of the day there's a saying:

**Key Points:**
- Build a custome model from scratch or use pre-built Model
- To built a model from scratch you need to create your own equation, which mean you need to know math
- Math consist of **geometry**, **algebra**, **statistics & probability**, and **calculus**
- **Statistics & probability** is needed for all data science role
- Having a limited understanding of **Linier Algebra** is going to help

**Key Points:**
- Predictive analytics and machine learning go hand-in-hand, as predictive models typically include a machine learning algorithm. - **[[SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_gb/insights/articles/analytics/a-guide-to-predictive-analytics-and-machine-learning.html)]**
- predictive analytics uses advanced mathematics to **examine patterns to predict the future.** 
-  **Machine learning is a tool that automates predictive modeling** by generating training algorithms to look for patterns and behaviors in data without explicitly being told what to look for. - **[[TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/Machine-learning-and-predictive-analytics-work-better-together)]**
- **The goal of machine learning is autonomous programming and learning – the enablement of AI**. The difference between data science vs. machine learning is that **data scientists create the algorithms that make machine learning happen**. - **[[CSWeb.Rice](https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/online-mds/blog/data-science-vs-ai-and-ml)]**

## Data Analyst Setup
Most of the data science tutorials in the internet require us to follow along by writing code, creating visuals, loading datasets, and doing statistics analysis ect. How am i gonna practice those if i don't have my computer ready, isn't?
